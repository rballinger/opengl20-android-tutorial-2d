# opengl20-android-tutorial-2d

This repository is me going through a tutorial on OpenGL 2.0 in Android.
Specifically, this tutorial covers 2D work including textures.

The tutorial can be found at <a href="http://androidblog.reindustries.com/a-real-open-gl-es-2-0-2d-tutorial-part-1/">OpenGL 2.0 Android Tutorial</a> as I am not the owner or creator of this work.

This is simply all of the source code from there, put onto a full repo that I used for learning, and for others to view as one whole project.
